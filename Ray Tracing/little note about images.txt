I included 6 results. 

Some of them have different number of spheres, or different resolution.

For each result, I included a JPG, GIF (animation), and an image of the scene on SIG.

I organized the results by file type (JPG, GIF, SIG image).

Also, some of the GIFS have had their quality reduced.

Here's some information about each result:

Result 1: 10 spheres. 640 x 480 pixels. 10 images for the GIF.
Result 2: 10 spheres. 640 x 480 pixels. 10 images for the GIF.
Result 3: 10 spheres. 640 x 480 pixels. 40 images for the GIF.
Result 4: 10 spheres. 640 x 480 pixels. 50 images for the GIF.
Result 5: 7 spheres. 1200 x 900 pixels. 40 images for the GIF.
Result 6: 7 spheres. 3200 x 1800 pixels. 40 images for the GIF. Took around 30 minutes to render.

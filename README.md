# Advanced-Graphics-Concepts

These projects were implemented in the Standalone Interactive Graphics (SIG) Toolkit, created by Professor Marcelo Kallmann.

Note: In order to run these projects, the files must be dropped in the SIG folder. Compile & Run on VS 2017. For more information, see the SIG examples/sample code [here](https://bitbucket.org/mkallmann/sig)

1. Primitives and Meshes
   - Built lots of parameterized object primitives and converted them into collections of triangles, or meshes. These models were represented as indexed triangles.
   - Implemented a scene graph where the gear object primitives rotate to form a physically correct gear system. (Animation)

2. Parametric Surfaces
   - Built curved objects based on parametric BÃ©zier patches.
   - Implemented functionality to control the polyhedron cage of the curved object.
   - Generated normal vectors to shade the model correctly.
   - Implemented functionality to change the resolution/number of triangles in the surface.
   - Implemented a shadow of the curved object, via projection matricies.

3. Ray Tracing
   - A Ray Tracing project with spheres that hold properties of reflectivity, transparency, and refraction.
